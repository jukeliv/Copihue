# Copihue
 Copihue the first high-level programming language made in Chile.
 It is an open-source, statically typed programming language made with C++

## Compiling Copihue
 I made this process really simple ( for me ) cuz i am lazy, so you need to run `build.bat` and it should compile
 ( if you are on linux just run `build.sh` )

## Compiling Copihue files
 also, really simple process, you just need to do this:
 `Copihue -FILE_NAME- -OUTPUT_FILE-`
